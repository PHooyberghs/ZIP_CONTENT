# ZIP_CONTENT
Retrieving data about the items enclosed in an NTFS compressed folder and store base information in a csv-file.

Unfortunatly, for now, I don't have the time to experiment with nested compression (zipfile within zipfile). So to found out what's in a nested zip, I don' se an other solution ten decompres the nested zipfile and run this script on it.
I'm convinced a better solution is possible, but that will be for later
